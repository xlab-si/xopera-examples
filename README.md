## Introduction
This repository contains working examples of blueprints (TOSCA templates and their implementations) for the
[xOpera orchestrator] `opera`. 
Their aim is to help authors and developers of [OASIS TOSCA] service templates get started with 
[OASIS YAML Simple Profile v1.3] and the use of [Ansible] automation tool for implementing TOSCA interface operations.
The examples here are also explained more in detail within the [xOpera documentation] page.

## Prerequisites
The main requirement for the examples to work is that we have the ``opera`` installed as detailed in the tool's 
*Prerequisites and Installation* section of the [opera README.md]. 
Each example is located in its own self-contained directory and contains README with some basic info about its purpose 
and running. 
Some examples may require special  resources, like infrastructure (OpenStack), cloud provider accounts (AWS, Azure, 
GCP).
