## Introduction
This repository contains working examples of blueprints (TOSCA templates and their implementations) for the
[xOpera orchestrator](https://github.com/xlab-si/xopera-opera) `opera`. Their aim is to help authors of 
[OASIS TOSCA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca) service templates get started with 
[OASIS YAML Simple Profile v1.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/cos01/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3-cos01.html) 
and the use of [Ansible automation](https://www.ansible.com/) for implementing TOSCA interfaces.

## Prerequisites
The main requirement for the examples to work is that we have the ``opera`` installed as detailed in the tool's 
Prerequisites and Installation section of the [opera README.md](https://github.com/xlab-si/xopera-opera/blob/master/README.md). 
Each example is located in its own self-contained directory and contains README with some basic info about its purpose 
and running. Some examples may require special  resources, like infrastructure (OpenStack), cloud provider accounts 
(AWS, Azure, GCP).
