# Cloud xOpera examples
This folder contains xOpera examples that can be used to deploy services on different popular cloud providers. We try to
provide simple blueprints that show the creation and usage of different cloud resources with xOpera and Ansible. Since
these examples are in general more complex, complex, they require more attention to satisfy the prerequisites. This 
means that you will need your cloud account to deploy the solution to a specific cloud provider and also you may need 
to install some other accompanying tools that are used for the deployment process.
