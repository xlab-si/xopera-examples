Python function for resizing images
-----------------------------------------

This is a python function for resizing images.

The function takes the original image from original bucket and creates three thumbnails (look for
`THUMBNAIL_SIZES_PX = [100, 160, 200]` in python code) which are then stored to the bucket with results.
