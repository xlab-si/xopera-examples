# xOpera TOSCA CSAR examples
This folder contains examples of extracted TOSCA CSAR files that can be deployed with `opera`. TOSCA CSARs are meant
to be a compressed archives (usually zip files) but we kept them extracted so that the users can see their content
here directly (and also because it's not a common practice to have compressed files in Git repository). These examples
are runnable with `opera` in their extracted version or they can be compressed (to a zip file) and deployed.
